# Two Pointers Technique

This document explains the Two Pointers pattern with a neutral and simple tone.

## Concept
The Two Pointers technique uses two indices that move through a structure in order to achieve an efficient solution. It often reduces time complexity from quadratic to linear.

## When to Use It
Use this pattern when the problem has order, symmetry or a monotonic structure. It is common in arrays and strings.

## Typical Movements of Pointers
1. Both pointers move in the same direction.
2. Pointers converge from opposite ends.
3. One pointer advances while the other waits for a condition.

## Advantages
The method uses constant extra space and often achieves linear time. It keeps logic simple and avoids nested loops.

## Classic Problems
1. Container With Most Water  
2. Trapping Rain Water  
3. Two Sum when the array is sorted  
4. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array

## Key Ideas to Remember
Understand what each pointer represents and how moving it changes the state. Choose which pointer to move based on what brings the state closer to the goal.
