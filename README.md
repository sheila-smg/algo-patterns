# Algo Patterns

This repository is a personal project designed to deepen my understanding of the core algorithmic patterns used to build efficient solutions.  
The aim is to practice structured problem-solving, refine intuition about complexity, and develop clean implementations that scale well.

Each folder focuses on one family of patterns and contains:
- A clear conceptual overview  
- Representative problems  
- A straightforward baseline solution  
- An optimized implementation  
- Notes summarizing the key insights behind the improvement  

Rather than collecting isolated exercises, this project organizes ideas into reusable mental frameworks that help me reason about algorithms with clarity and precision.


## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore how different algorithmic strategies behave, why certain approaches are more efficient than others, and how small design decisions affect performance.

This includes:
- Recognizing structure in problems  
- Understanding time and space complexities  
- Transitioning from brute-force ideas to elegant, optimized patterns  
- Building modular, readable code that reflects strong algorithmic thinking  


## Patterns Included

The repository is structured by core families of algorithmic techniques:

algo-patterns/
sliding_window/
fixed_window/
variable_window/
frequency_window/
two_pointers/
prefix_sum/
hashing/
binary_search_on_answer/


More categories may be added over time as the project grows.


## How to Use This Repository

1. Choose a pattern folder  
2. Start from the conceptual notes  
3. Read the baseline solution to understand the simple idea  
4. Explore the optimized version and its reasoning  
5. Reflect on complexity differences and structural insights  

The intention is to learn not only how solutions work, but why they work.


## Roadmap

- Add more problems per pattern  
- Add small visual explanations or diagrams where useful  
- Add unit tests for each solution  
- Add complexity summaries and quick-reference notes  
- Expand into additional algorithmic families (heaps, intervals, stacks, DP, etc.)


## About This Project

Created as part of my ongoing practice to write better algorithms, understand efficiency deeply, and organize knowledge in structured way.
